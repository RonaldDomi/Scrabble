Scrabble game implementation made with python.

There are 2 entry points, either _game.py_ or _screen.py_
game.py is a console implementation and the game is played on the console.
screen.py is the same concept translated into a graphical interface.

This is a 2 player turn based game where each turn a player can skip/place or draw a 
new letter. There is a board with bonuses, and by the end the player with the most 
points wins.
